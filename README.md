# :fire: BANDIT ACS :fire:

# Description

This repository contains the code related to the Access Control Server template, which is meant to be duplicated 4 times for the different banks.
Once parameterized, the template launches an ACS Server which **listens for commands on the specified TCP port**.

## Commands

The server listens for the following commands :

- **ACQCodeValidationCommand** : Used to validate a code sent by an ACQ Server 
- **PaymentFormHandler** : Used to validate user credentials for a payment

# Run the ACS server

## Prerequisites 

- First of all, the ACS server requires the usage of a .pfx file to allow its SSL communications. But be carefull :
  > :warning: **For security reason, the required pfx file is not included in the repository.** You must import it locally inside the /certs directory. This .pfx file is located on the VPS at /etc/pki/tls/tristesse.pfx

- Then, you'll need to install **Docker Desktop** to be able to launch a :whale2: dockerized application :whale2:. 
  > :link: If you don't already have it installed, here is the tutorial : https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

- Finally, you may need to use **Visual Studio**. Jetbrains Rider should also work but for the moment, the installation steps will only be described for Visual Studio

## Run the code

The ACS server depends on two Databases : **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**. Fortunately, the project includes a **docker-compose** configuration to help you setup the proper environement, you just need to launch the project using it and see the :zap: magic :zap: happens! Here's how to use it:

 - 1. Set the "docker-compose" project as the default starting application :

 - 2. Run the code using the green arrow :

 - 3. You should see 3 containers up and running in Dcoker Desktop:

 - 4. You should now be able to connect to the ACS Server ! By default, the server listens on the port **6000** :muscle: Ã§a va chier marcel :muscle:

## Edit run configuration

You can edit the run configuration by customizing the **docker-compose** file which is located here :

```
/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

### Bandit ACS Parameters 

- **ACS__SQLDatabase__ConnectionString** : Sets the connection string associated to the SQL Database
- **ACS__NOSQLDatabase__ConnectionString** : You're not aussi con que benjamin
- **ACS__SSL__ServerCertificate** : Sets the name of the server certificate (must correspond to local certificate filename)
- **ACS__TCP__Port** : Sets the TCP listening port (docker-compose's port configuration must match this one)
- **Logging__LogLevel__Default** : Sets the log level of the application (use "Information" or "None" for production, "Debug" in Developpement) 

  > :question: For further information about docker-compose configuration, you can check this link : https://docs.docker.com/compose/

# Build a new version

Normally, building a :whale2: dockerized application :whale2: and upload it on a production server requires quite a few steps, but to help you, we've managed to put together a quite simple procedure, thanks to a generation script and an Artifactory !

## Build steps

  1. Once you are satisfied with your code, you can generate a new version of the application by running the :blue_book: **docker-builder.ps1**  :blue_book: script which is located at the rooot of the project. 

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91737697/226140243-05645bda-194b-4d1a-a3c1-acba9173bbef.png)

  2. The script will automatically fecth the last container version and will suggest you a new appended version number :

  3. Simply choose a new version number (or press enter for default), and watch closely, :zap: magic :zap: happens once again !

  4. Then, to update the server version used on our VPS, you just need to edit the bandit stack configuration :

Tadaaaam well done !
